	Although crypto currency is a relatively new idea, this does not make it a fad. Pokemon cards are a fad. I don't accept large quantities of Pokemon cards as payment. 
	While they're some valuable Pokemon cards in circulation, I don't believe they're going to maintain there value over the duration of a lifetime. I cannot bury Pokemon cards in the backyard
	and expect future generations to be able to derive value from them. However, I believe crypto currency will retain value over the course of many generations. Crypto currency is not a fad.
	</p>
	<p>
	With globalization in consideration, I believe we are slowly trending toward the idea of a one world currency. We need a medium of exchange which is globally accepted. We saw something
	similar transpire in the EU with the creation of the euro. However, I do not believe this transition will come quickly or cheaply. We're going to see the evolution of this currency
	over the next one hundred years, but I believe crypto is the initial seed of this tree. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I am open to the idea that I've been wrong before, and I believe other people should be understanding of this too. Moreover, a person should keep a well diversified portfolio. Keep your house.
	Don't sell all of your property and invest your life savings into Bitcoin. However, if it were me, I'd be open to the idea that crypto currency is definitely not a fad. Crypto is not the equivalent of
	Pokemon cards. Crypto is the future. Calling this technology a fad is similar to saying that aritifical intelligence is a fad. People just sound like they either don't understand
	what a fad is, or they're not educated well enough on blockchain technology to have an opinion.
	</p>
	<p>
	Nonetheless, if you'd like to be on the cutting edge of technology, you should better educate yourself about crypto currency and blockchain technology. While there is plenty of good literature
	on the subject, I am sure the Internet has pages which also dive into the inner workings of how blockchains function. If you'd like to pay my salary in Bitcoin, I'd be okay with that.
	I believe investing in crypto is a good idea.
