<h2>August 9th, 2023 - Learning in the Active</h2>

	Learning in the active is a method for success in fields such as cybersecurity. I've used this term before in previous posts, and I am trying to communicate that you can not predict
	what you're going to learn by doing something. Theory is great in practice. I am often highly captivated by technical people who love to talk about protocol and regulatory standards, as I am one of them.
	However, if you've not ever conducted a live penetration test, your theory is going to be missing some practical knowledge.
	</p>
	<p>
	I use to broadcast live penetration tests on Facebook with a screen recording software and some plug-in. This was a great way to learn under pressure. It was a similar feeling as having to conduct a live penetration test
	with a supervisor or potential client watching. You're nervous, barely ready, and incredibly insecure about everything you know. I realized after doing this a few times that I needed a better methodology
	for conducting a penetration test. I needed steps I could reference back to when I became nervous and forgot why I had a list of running processes for the system up.
	</p>
	<p>
	There is a lot I learned about how to conduct a penetration test by learning in the active. I learned a lot by conducting a live penetration test with a decent portion of my friends watching. In scope, I perceive stating that
	I conducted a live penetration test as a vague communication. Like, on what, a plane? A Tesla? No. Once I configured an Ubuntu server OS in a virtual box environment, which was runnning a version of Apache with 
	some known vulnerabilities. I had been well aware of the vulnerabilities before hand because I am the one who configured them. Often times, I'd run an insecure version of a Windows OS in a virtual box and demonstrate
	how simple it could be to gain remote access. Moreover, my point is that I learned a lot by configuring these virtual environments and then using my practical knowledge to break into said virtual environments. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Personally, I'd rather come to the conclusion that live penetration testing makes me nervous in a demo environment. In comparison, I could've learned this out on a real playing field where there were lives
	at stake. There is a lot to be learned when learning in the active. How much do you really know if you've not ever put your practical knowledge to the test? I imagine penetration testing is very similar to heart surgery.
	In theory, you'll probably do fine. In reality, probably doing fine isn't good enough when someones life is on the line. You want to be confident that you know what you're doing.
