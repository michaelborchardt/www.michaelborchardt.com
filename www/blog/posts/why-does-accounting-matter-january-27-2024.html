<h2>January 27th, 2024 - Why Does Accounting Matter?</h2>

		While keeping track of financial movements may seem to be a tedious process, I understand keeping accurate records as good housekeeping. Financial records provide businesses
		with the ability to review past performance. Financial records also provide businesses with the ability to speculate on future performance. However, if your financial records
		are not accurate, then your ability to do either of these things becomes less so.
	</p>
	<p>
		Furthermore, keeping track of accurate financial records is also a matter of ethics. There are entire divisions of large corporations dedicated to making sure that financial
		records are being kept accurately, which is a matter of liability. In order to be a publicly traded company, a corporation must provide government agencies with copies of their 
		financial statements. Generating false documentation on how much a company earned during a given period is a crime. Moreover, there is more than one government agency tasked with monitoring
		the financial statements generated by a corporation. The Securities Exchance Commission (SEC) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are a few examples of such agencies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, accounting records, often called financial statements, are what managers of an organization review to determine whether or not a business is making a profit. While this is arguably one of the more
		important reasons to keep accurate financial records, this is incredibly important to the core function of the business. Moreover, most businesses exist to
		earn a profit. Unless a business is a non-profit orgnanization. However, if you want a business to earn a profit, then keeping meticulous track of financial records is incredibly important.
	</p>
	<p>
		In summation, although they're many reasons to keep accurate accounting records, the most important tend to be for reason of not being implicated in a crime, such as fraud. However, I believe
		the most important reason after this is to determine whether or not a business is making a profit, which is the goal of most businesses. Last, but not least, is to review past performance and better
		predict future performance.
