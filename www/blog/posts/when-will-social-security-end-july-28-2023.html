<h2> July 28th, 2023 - When Will Social Security End </h2>
<section>
<p>As of today, I have decided to create a blog. While maintaining a professional appearence online is important, I would still like to portray a personal side to my identity. However, although I don't have much to talk about right now,
I would still appreciate having a blog to reflect on as a recording of my past thoughts. </p>

<p><strong>I assert that any model attempting to quantify the future with the use of numeric constants may be less accurate as the time variable increases ...</strong> </p>
<p> As of most recently, I have finished reading a book which has me considering how far into the future humans are capable of making accurate forecasts. By which I am communicating, how quality is a model which forecasts too far into
	the future. As probability may suggest, a model which forecasts too far into the future is most likely a very low quality model. For reasons why, I am going to state that a model forecasting too far into the future assumes
	far too much.
	 Predictions of the future can only be so accurate, which is the truth. Rarely are weather pattern predictions accurate beyond the scope of a one week time frame.
	Most would consider a weather forecast for a one year time frame to be entirely ridiculous, which leads into my next point. If we consider an attempt to forecast weather one year into the future ludicrous, then why not
	a forecast of the budget for social security benefits fifty years into the future? What is the probability of a fifty year forecast being accurate? How many constants are these models based off which could change?
</p>
<p>
	We understand that weather pattern predictions beyond the scope of a few days to be innaccurate from experience, which is what we're lacking when considering forecasts for social security in fifty years.
	 We will never have enough data to generate an accurate model for a fifty year forecast. 
	In simple terms, most people do not have the experience to understand why a model predicting a fifty year forecast is a hilarious thought. 
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Models which forecast fifty year predictions assume far too much to be accurate.
	</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	 There is far too much spontaneity in the universe to accurately predict the degree of randomn chaos which could develop over the course of fifty years. In essence, I am communicating that they're too many 
	random variables to account for. Models are generated assuming numeric constants, and models are generated with certain underlying assumptions. 
	When constructing a model to generate a forecast of future events, you can only assume so much until you're just wrong.
	 Models of the future, which represent forecasts, are less accurate than most would care to admit. In some cases, you're better off visiting a fortune teller...
	</p>
<p>
	How many assumptions have to be 100% accurate for these models to be certain? Too many. Far too many. Moreover, economists generate models to give a semblance of control over the economy. 
	In all reality, the economy is a raging monster which feeds on the souls of the living at its own discretion. We have little control over economic fluctuation. Many models exist to make people feel better (or worse). 
	Furthermore, I believe the underlying problem with most is that they do not question models developed by people
	attempting to generate an incentive for other people to act. I understand skeptical thought is taught at almost every level of education. Then, why, are people not less prone to deducing what I am asserting now. Models
	assuming far too many constants are not accurate forecasts of the future.
</p>
	<p> However, I encourage you not to misinterpret what I am communicating. I do understand that making sure social security benefits are still around in fifty years is important. I just don't think government transfer payments
	are going to disappear because of some shit model.
	 In a literal fashion, 
	I do not believe the economy is a raging monster which feeds on the souls of the living. 
	If you have met me before, then you may recognize my candid humor. I am just suggesting that models make people feel better (or worse) about what little control they have over their future reality. 
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>The point I am trying to communicate is that we should be questioning forecasts which claim facts that exist fifty years into the future.</strong> 
	</p>
	<p>
	We should be questioning the certainty of these models. We should
	be questioning which constants were used, and I believe we should be questioning for what purpose these models were created. Who am I to argue with someone who is giving humanity incentive to act
	against a lack of social security benefits. I dislike this idea, and I am not going to argue with the people trying to prevent this phenomenon. 
	I think people are scared of the idea that social security could end, which is why they generated models to support their belief, so they could do something about the issue before it began.
	I am only asking people to consider the probability of a model forecasting fifty years into the future as having any accuracy whatsoever, which in all reality is a very low probability.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Social security payments are not ever going to end. They're always going to be government transfers, which even out the fluctuations in our macro-economy. The model which forecasted that social
		 security would end was complete shit. </strong>
