	I am a skeptical empiricist, and I question the truth value of all claims which assert fact.	
	</p>
	<p>
	People are misleading. Furthermore, people often have an agenda. Models are very real, but they're often used to mislead people; models are often used to create a call to action. This is why which economists
	you surround yourself with is very important. Ten different economists may assume ten different things, which is interesting to me. I no longer trust economists. I am inclined to favor certain models over 
	others, but this is only because they suggest action which favor my political beliefs. In economics, they're ten different roads which lead to the same village. An increase in government transfer payments
	will increase consumer spending as much as a tax cut to the top 1% of Americans, and I understand the impact on real GDP will be very similar. The crux of the matter is really which political camp you live in. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I am often skeptical of models I like too much. I carry this principle over to the concept of ideas. I am incredibly skeptical of ideas I like too much. Often times, I apply this principal to people as well.
	I am just flat out distrusting of people I like too much. If I like someone too much, I can't help but feel manipulated by them. Humans are inherently flawed, messy creatures. We start wars and make nonsense
	of our personal lives. We use models to manipulate the average consumer.
	</p>
	<p>
	 I assert every human
	is inherently flawed in some way. I would reference this as the law of being human. If no one is sure about why you're a flawed human being, you're doing a great job. 
	Keep it up. When I'm not quite sure what is wrong with a human, I trust them much less. I prefer when someones
	flaws are obvious. They're less of a security concern that way.
