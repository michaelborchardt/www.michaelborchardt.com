<h2>August 8th, 2023 - Best Predictors of Future Markets</h2>
</section>
<section>
	<p>
	Technology, social movement, and random luck. Let me state a brief disclaimer. While I would consider myself better than the average person at forecasting the success of a publicly traded company, I am by no
	definition Warren Buffet. I have not made a billion dollars trading on public companies. However, I am highly qualified to be writing a post on the best predictor of future markets, as I am great at observing lucrative
	trends. I rarely believe in my own models or forecasts, as I am a hardcore skeptic of anything which claims to accurately predict the future. 
	</p>
	<p>
	From my own experience, a trend I would tend to notice is observed as a result of technological break through or social movement. Technology which increases our capacity for work output often creates a
	noticeable shift in the macro-economy. Consider what I just said. Technology which will dramatically increase the output from a single worker will shift the macro-economy. The personal
	computer was a great example of this. I would consider the crux of this matter timing. I'm assuming you're here reading this because you want to make money. 
	Well, there you go. Timing. The time from the point you notice a technology which will increase work output to the time you find a publicly traded business which is applying this technology to increase work output.
	</p>
	<p>
	Aritifical intelligence is also a great example of this. I've been studying the impact of AI and machine learning since 2013, and I believe we're starting to see
	the true application of the technology in many different facets of the private business sector. Artificial intelligence was first utilized in reserach. It slowly began to become mainstream through out the private
	business sector. What we're seeing right now is a pinnacle of application for this technology, which some are referencing as an AI bubble. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I never try to model or forecast a trend for how rapidly a technology will be adapted by the private business sector. In essence, I would be a huge tool if I were to tell you these models were 100% accurate.
	While I could generate models which communicated to you that the application of AI and machine learning will increase over the course of the next ten years, I am at best making a prediction. Although I could suggest
	to you that there is a certain degree of accuracy and risk in these models, that is the best I can do without feeling like a tool. All models 
	forecast a prediction of what someone believes is going to happen. I believe this is going to happen. My science and data point in this direction. This does not make my models and predictions accurate. Thus, why this blog post
	is titled the best "predictors" of future markets.
	</p>
	<p>
	On to social movement. While break through and innovation in technology is a great way to identify trends which will have signficant impact on the macro-economy, social movement is also a category where
	I find myself identifying impacts on the macro-economy. By this term social movement, I am communicating the resulting impact which state and federal policies have on the macro-economy. For example,
	the legalization of marijuana and marijuana based products. Although I am not a marijuana user, I can't help but notice a significant amount of Americans vocalizing support for the legalization of marijuana.
	I understand with the legalization of marijuana comes the legalization of marijuana based businesses. My models and data have suggested for years now that investing in the infrastructure surrounding
	the legalization of marijuana to be a lucrative position. 
	</p>
	<p>
	As I have stated, I rarely listen to my models and data. On this point, I have listened to my models and data. I have allocated a significant portion of my resources into investing in the infrastructure
	supporting the marijuana industry. I have also invested a significant amount into companies which utlize artificial intelligence to increase workflow output capacity. There is a certain degree of random luck thrown 
	into investing in any industry. Luck that the data you've collected and models you've use to project your forecasts is not incorrect. I've seen people place faith in what I would consider a very skewed model.  
	</p>
	<p>
	While they're are many different ways to make money in the stock market, these are just a few thoughts I've had over the years about how to increase your chances of making a profit. To recap: (1) identify technologies
	which greatly increase the output of a worker, and (2) you can identify social trends which lead to lucrative industries. I am sure they're many other paths to the riches you seek. Other individuals
	have identified they're own methods. These are simply my methods.
