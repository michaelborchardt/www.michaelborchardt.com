<h2>July 31st, 2023 - What I Learned From My First Business</h2>

<section>
	<p>
	Often times, a person is too committed to learning in the passive stance, and I believe this greatly hinders the quality of their learning experience.
	Theory is great. Theory is incredibly relevant and highly applicable. But they're lessons you only learn when you're out learning in the active stance.
	</p>
	<p>
	For example, I have read many books about starting a business.
	There is a lot of great advice in literature. Although theory is only so useful, being in the real world applying business concepts will develop skills you can only learn in the active stance.
	If you want to learn more about business beyond what a book can teach you, then you should go out and start one. Go out and do something. Learn from mistakes. As I like to say, go learn in the active stance. 
	</p>
	<p>
	When I was in my early twenties, I started a business called "Top Floor Solutions," which arguably had the vaguest tagline definition ever.
	My tagline advertised the business as a software consulting firm. But what does a
	software consulting firm do? People were confused about what I did, which is how I ended up doing a lot of random things.
	My most signficant mistake was poor service definition,
	but this is how I learned about services the technology market needed. 
	</p>
	<p>
	When I started Top Floor Solutions, I wasn't concerned about what people would think, and I wasn't concerned with what people would say about me. 
	I'm not the type of person who listens to negative comments from other people, and I'm not the type of person who believes in defining limits. If someone didn't believe in what I was doing,
	I'd let them know that this was alright. However, this was a rare occurrence, as I was good at surrounding myself with supportive people. 
	My main concern was starting a business. Bring me a technology related problem. I'll tell you what I think, or I'll try to fix it for you. If I thought I was in over my head, I'd be the first to let you know.
	For some reason, I ended up developing a lot of websites.
	People thought I was in the website business. I have no idea how software consultant was interpreted as website developer, but I was accepting of this. My service definition was vague.
	</p>
	<p>
	Moreover, I found that website security was an incredibly popular market. I fielded more questions about how to secure a website in my first year of business than anything else; people wanted to know
	how to secure their web applications. Secure web applications generate consumer confidence in a platform. 
	</p>
	<p>
	A significant portion of my income was generated through poor service definition, which is a really interesting mistake to have made. Intentional poor service definition isn't something	
	they taught me in business school. In business school, I was taught I should survey the needs of my target market. Only then should I attempt to start a business, which provides a service
	that fulfills a need. I should of better understood what services were
	needed before hand.
	 Business school did not teach me to launch a business catering
	an unknown service to an unknown market just to see what people would pay me to do. 
	</p>
	<p>
	After reviewing the data I collected over the first two years of business, I realized there was a serious need for cybersecurity engineers who specialized in web application security, and I realized that cybersecurity
	was an incredibly interesting field to be in, too. This is why I entered the field of cybersecurity.. I evolved in the active stance, or I evolved by
	taking action and doing something. 
	</p>
	<p>
	As an amateur statistician, I am not advising you start a business with an undefined purpose. The odds of this business venture ending up successful are slim to nothing. 
	I highly recommend you define your target market, and I also recommend you define what service you're going to provide to this market. Business school wasn't wrong.                                                             
	I am communicating that you do not ever know what is going to evolve by taking action and learning in the active stance.
