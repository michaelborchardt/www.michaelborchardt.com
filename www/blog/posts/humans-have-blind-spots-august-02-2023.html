<h2>August 2nd, 2023 - Humans Have Blind Spots</h2>

	Had you been able to predict the next significant cyber attack against your organization, I'm sure you would of taken care to mitigate risk appropriately. 
       	Sometimes we're just not aware of a threat. Sometimes a threat is in our blind spot.
	However, this is why communication and community is so important.
	</p>
	<p>
	When you consider communication and community, this is why fostering an environment which brings people together to collaborate is imperative to any organization. I am only able to mitigate risks when I understand a 
	threat exists. A second person may see a threat that I wouldn't have. As humans, we're only capable of perceiving so much. A group of people may be able to better perceive a threat than two people alone.
	</p>
	<p>
	Often times, a person may be able to help observe a second persons blind spot. I believe this principal could also apply to groups of people. When two people spend too much time together, they often
	begin to think in similar patterns. This phenomenon is often referenced as herd mentality. In my opinion, a person who is not a member of a particular herd may better understand a herds blind spot.	
	</p>
	<p>
	Had I known a tree was going to fall on my house, I would of purchased homeowner's insurance. This idea communicates the problem with cybersecurity. Had an orgnization been aware of the bug in their
	website that could be exploited, I am sure they would of taken care to patch the bug in their site.
	</p>
	<p>
	My point is that it is important to spend time thinking about your blind spots. Be skeptical of areas where you are too confident. Be considerate of others opinion, as community exists for a reason.
