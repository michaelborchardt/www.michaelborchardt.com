	In all reality, they're massive amounts of data collected on average citizens each year. This is just the world we live in.
	There is plenty of literature about how to reduce your digital footprint, but there is not much to read on how to make your digital footprint work for you.
	First off, let us define this term digital footprint. A digital footprint is the aggregate sum of data collected on your average person. For example,
	your Facebook account is part of your digital footprint. It is the data you leave behind from using a service.
	</p>
	<p>
	I recently read a book about how to reduce your digital footprint, and I think this idea is running in the wrong direction. I think they're better uses
	of your data points than reducing them. While I agree that we should not be using insecure services, I still believe we should be using secure services.
	Often times, a person will connect their device or register their personal information with services before considering if they're exposing their personal information
	to an insecure platform. 
	</p>
	<p>
	 How do you make your digital footprint work for you? I think you should be more conscious of what data your putting into services. What do you want your data to say about you?
	 In my own opinion, I would like my data to suggest that I am a thoughtful, kind, average person. Never before in history has there been a time when a company
	 could analyze your current mood and feelings based off of the contents of a private email. I would like all of my private emails to suggest I am an average person. 
	</p>
	<p>
	To use your digital footprint to your advantage, you must be conscious of every interaction you make using services. This includes, but is not limited to,
	the emails you send, the text messages you send, who you're contacting, your browsing history, and which services you subscribe to. Everything to do with technology
	leaves a trace. The aggregate sum of your data is a compilation of your character and reputation. While humans generate a significant amount of data throughout the average day,
	I am not sure if the idea of sorting through it all is even tenable. But it could be, and that is my point.
	</p>
	<p>
	As I've stated, the average person generates a significant amount of data on a daily basis. Moreover, if you were to dramatically reduce your data output, you would be a statistical outlier.
	A person not generating a significant amount of data is a pretty noticeable event. I believe you'd be considered an outlier for not using a significant portion of services. If you're trying to blend in,
	then using popular services is the best idea.
	</p>
	<p>
	In effect, rather than reduce my digital footprint, I would use my digital footprint to be an obviously average human being. I would hide in plain sight. In my opinion, the more data collected the better, as long as you're
	conscious about your data input.
