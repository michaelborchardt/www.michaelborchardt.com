<h2>August 11th, 2023 - Paycheck or Passion</h2>
</section>
<section>
	<p>
	I am in the middle of reading a book which communicates an interesting point.
	If you're not passionate about what you're doing, then you're most likely not as effective at doing it than people who are. This principle is meant to be applied to cybersecurity
	engineers and penetration testers. Those who are passionate about security are more effective at their job than those who are not.
	</p>
	<p>
	I agree with this idea, and I have also observed this trend. Some say that it takes all kinds. This is very true. The kind of person working as a cybersecurity engineer, who is passionate
	about security, is going to be much more effective at what they do. They're interested in what they're doing. They're consistently growing in their passion. They're not bored to tears going
	over the data, and they don't consider their work another job they have to do. In my opinion, this is one of those jobs a person eats and sleeps with. A person takes this job home and it becomes who they are.
	I am a cybersecurity engineer and a penetration tester. My job is to secure physical and digital assets, revise controls and protocol, and create a peace of mind condition for the client.
	</p>
	<p>
	As I continued reading this book, the further communicated that a lack of passion is why security professionals are losing the fight against cybercrime. I seriously appreciate this authors passion, and I agree 
	with him. If you understand the mentality behind black hat hackers, then you're well aware the only thing fueling these actors is passion. They are highly passionate people.
	 In most cases, they are not motivated by paycheck, but they're motivated to act according to their own passion. A linear trend among all black hat hackers is that they are all highly passionate people.
	</p>
	<p>
	In my opinion, every black hat hacker goes about their business for different reasons. I believe the most generic belief is that black hat hackers do it for the fame. If we were able to do an accurate 
	statistical analysis, I think the last thing most hackers want is to be famous. I understand to be a famous hacker, you must be caught hacking something. Very rarely does a person commit a criminal
	action just so they can be caught. This doesn't make sense to me. Nonetheless, black hat hackers are highly passionate about what they're doing, and they're acting for a number of reasons. 
	</p>
	<p>
	If we want to win the fight against cybercrime, I think we need to do a better job of attracting highly passionate people to the field of cybersecurity. People need to be inspired to act. As we've discussed,
	the other side is full of highly passionate people.
