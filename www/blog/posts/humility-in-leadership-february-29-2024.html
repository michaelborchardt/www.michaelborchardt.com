<h2>February 29th, 2024 - Humility in Leadership.</h2>
</section>
<section>
<p>
   While I perceive being humble as a noble trait, I understand this trait as very marketable when found in people who are in leadership roles. Foremost, I should define leadership. Leadership
   is (1) being responsible for other humans, and (2) caring about other humans wellness. I do not believe being responsible for other people is enough to qualify a person as a leader.
   However, when a person is responsible for other people and is caring about the wellness of these individuals, I believe this is drilling into what leadership is.
</p>
<p>
   Furthermore, humility manifests itself in many forms. For example, I understand humility as being willing to work with the people below you in the chain of command. When a subordinate
   approaches a boss with an idea, issue, or comment, then the boss should provide a listening ear. This is humility. 
</p>
<p>
   However, when in a leadership role, having humility does not equate to doing everything for a subordinate. In my own opinion, being a humble leader is taking the time to work
   with a subordinate. Teaching a human to do something for themselves is much more effective than doing something for them. While a good leader does accomplish goals, I believe a good leader
   does this with the help of the individuals they lead. They do not do this all on their own.
