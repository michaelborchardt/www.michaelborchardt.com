	<p>
	While all of the latest technologies may make a CISO feel confident in their security solutions, I believe these technologies only provide a false sense of security.
	An organization will not ever be 100% secure, and this is the posture we must assume with security. At this point in time, I believe this is common knowledge.
	Appropriately configured intrusion detection systems and firewalls will be helpful. However, users of these systems must remain vigilant.
	</p>
	<p>
	Furthermore, I believe the human element of security is the weakest link, which is why I suggest vigilance. Vigilance is a mindset which implies that a user must be aware
	that something could go wrong at any moment. A different way to communicate this idea would be to state that, company wide, all personnel must always be on their toes.
	Although vigilance among front-line managers is helpful, this mindset of vigilance must be company wide. From c-suite executives to company janitors, the mindset of vigilance 
	must be pervasive through a company. We must all be mindful that people could be trying to steal our data.
	</p>
	<p>
	A better question: how do we instill vigilance through an organization? We cannot simply dictate in company policy that all employees be vigilant of potential exploits
	to organization vulnerabilities. This might be helpful, but this is not a solution.
	Vigilance is instilled throughout a company via awareness training and routine meetings. If I were a CISO, I would take time once a week to 
	conduct a review with other senior leadership about our security posturing.
	</p>
	<p>
	 Whether this be via a newsletter or an in-person meeting, I would take the time
	to remind personnel each week that vulnerabilities exist. If senior leadership, and the people beneath senior leadership, are consistenly being reminded of the risks 
	posed to security, they will be more conscious of these risks. Being more conscious of these risks is a step in the direction of maintaining a state of vigilance.
	</p>
	<p>
	If I were in the position of a CISO, I would try to schedule security awareness trainings as often as possible. The threat model is constantly evolving, and I understand
	the vulnerabilities an organization is exposed to as also constantly evolving. Organization personnel must be updated about the current threats to an organization as frequently as possible.
	Organization personnel must be well trained on how to best counter the efforts of bad actors. 
	</p>
	<p>
	We must not ever become relaxed in our security posturing. As you may already understand, when an organiation becomes relaxed, this is the best time to strike. This is the
	opportunity bad actors have been waiting for. Bad actors are patiently waiting for a period of time where an organization isn't expecting a security breach. We must 
	remain in a constant state of vigilance, as this is the best way to secure the human element. As I've stated, the human element is securities weakest link. Keep the human element vigilant.
