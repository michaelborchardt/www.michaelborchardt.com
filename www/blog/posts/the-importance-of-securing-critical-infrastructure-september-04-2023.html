<h2>September 4th, 2023 - The Importance of Securing Critical Infrastructure</h2>
</section>
<section>
	<p><strong>Introduction.</strong></p>
	<p>
	Although this term mission critical is often used, I do not believe we've established a quality understanding of what this term is communicating. How do we define mission critical infrastructure? As I understand
	this situation, mission critical infrastructure is all infrastructure used to support operation of a nation's economy. If we think of this situation in terms of a small organization, 
	I would consider what our number one objective with
	security is. I perceive our number one objective with security as ensuring business continuity. If we cannot operate our business, we cannot make our money, which is the number one objective of any for-profit organization.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, if we apply this number one objective to the macro-economy, then we could deduce that our primary objective is to provide business continuity for all businesses within the economy. If the economy stops functioning, then 
	people will no longer be able to obtain the means for their survival. People would not be able to survive without a functioning economy. Maintaining a functioning economy is mission critical.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Energy.</strong></p>
	<p>
	What keeps the economy running? The most obvious point in the attack surface is the energy sector. Without energy to power the businesses, the businesses will not be able to function. All businesses use computers, POS systems,
	and lights. All energy sectors
	should be considered mission critical infrastructure. All energy plants should be considered a high priority of security for a nation. 
	</p>
	<p><strong>Banking.</strong></p>
	<p>
	While securing the energy sector is important, I would consider securing the banking systems of equal importance. If the computers at the store will not turn on, I cannot purchase food. If my debit card does not work, I will 
        also not be able to purchase food. Creating a secure banking system is of mission critical importance. However, I understand this situation as complex. 
	A significant portion of the banking system is controlled by private businesses.
	Private businesses hate spending money when they don't have to. Moreover, if they do not perceive a threat, then why would they invest in securing their infrastrucure? What threat are we speaking of? In security,
	we often speak of an unknown unknown, or a threat we don't know that we don't know about. In this situation, we're talking about expecting the unexpected. Being prepared for a threat that we don't know we don't know about.
	</p>
	<p>
	So, how do we provide incentive for private businesses to secure mission critical infrastrure? The answer is through policy and regulation. There needs to be policy and regulatory measures in place to control
	how security is handled for private sector industries.
	Politicians are the people who will lobby for policy dictating stricter regulation for private sector businesses.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Supply Chain.</strong></p>
	<p>
	After the COVID 19 pandemic, our nation realized just how important a well functioning supply chain is. A well functioning supply chain delivers every day products to store shelves where consumers are able to purchase
	them for use. I would consider securing supply chain continuity as second to energy and banking. Planes, trucks, trains, and ships. I am speaking about mechanisms of delivery. While I would consider these
	mission critical infrastructure, I would also consider this a very complex target for an average black hat hacker. It would require a small nation-state to successfuly disrupt the supply chain of a 
	sophisticated country. 
	</p>
	<p><strong>Public Services.</strong></p>
	<p>
	On our list of mission critical components to an econony, I would rank public services as third. In order to have a functioning economy, we need police to keep the peace. We need first responders to respond to events
	which require their aide. Public services keep our nation running in a uniform manner. Imagine this scenario. A small nation-state decides to insert a list of multiple events into a cities emergency response database, which 
	requires the dispatch of first responders. If the first responders are busy responding to fake events, then how are they going to help the people in need? I've imagined similar scenarios before. I can't think
	of a real motive behind why someone would do this. However, if this scenario were to occur, then this would create mass panic as first responders fly around the city responding to fake events. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I would consider utilities such as water filtration plants a public service. Why is clean water not higher of importance? Because they're many ways to filter your water. I perceive utilities such as 
	water filtration plants to be of a serious threat, which is why they're on the list, but I do not perceive them as a direct disruption to the continuity of the nation's economy.
