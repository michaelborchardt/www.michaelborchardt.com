<!-- Definition for Social Engineering -->
<section>
<p>
	Social engineering is the process by which threat actors use glib and charm to steal information from unsuspecting victims. For example, a whaling attack is an example of social
	engineering at work. Whaling is the process by which a threat actor targets a CEO or other high level executive with emails, which prompt for personal information or information
	about private business engagements. This is very similar to phishing or spear phishing. Phishing attacks are indiscriminate email campaigns (usually targeting a less aware population
	of users) that prompt users for personal information. Spear phishing is a customized email campaign against an individual, which is much less broad in scope.
</p>
<p>
	Many people have noted that the greatest risk to any organization is not weaknesses in the physical or digital security, but the human element. In any organization, humans are by far the greatest vulnerability.
	Often times, employees will disclose personal information or proprietary business information without giving much thought to the nature of what they're doing. Humans are inclined to want to be helpful
	to other humans. Social engineering exploits this element of the human personality.  
</p>
<p>
	Holding security awareness training events which prepare employees who are handling sensitive information against social engineering attacks should be mandatory in any organization. If you're an employee
	handling sensitive information, you should be aware of the different strategies threat actors will try and use to get you to divulge sensitive information.
