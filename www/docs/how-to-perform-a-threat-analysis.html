<p>
	A <a href="root\terms\cybersecurity\threat-analysis.html">threat analysis</a> begins with taking inventory of an organization's <a href="root\terms\cybersecurity\assets.html">assets</a>.
	 Furthermore, a <a href="root\terms\cybersecurity\threat-analysis.html">threat analysis</a> involves assessing
	the types of risk associated with each <a href="root\terms\cybersecurity\assets.html">asset</a>. An <a href="root\terms\cybersecurity\assets.html">asset</a> 
	is something of value that could be perceived as useful to the business, or something that is vital to business operations. Assets could be computers and other 
	hardware, as well as algorithms and other proprietary information. 
	After we've defined the <a href="\root\terms\cybersecurity\risk.html">risk</a> associated with each <a href="root\terms\cybersecurity\assets.html">asset</a>, 
	we can start to define groups of actors who may want to exploit such <a href="\root\terms\cybersecurity\risk.html">risks</a>. Moreover, people who want to exploit
	<a href="\root\terms\cybersecurity\risk.html">risks</a> are considered threats. <a href="\root\terms\cybersecurity\risk.html">Risks</a> that are capable of being exploited are defined as vulnerabilities.
</p>
<p>
	As we've come to understand, vulnerabilties are <a href="\root\terms\cybersecurity\risk.html">risks</a> that are capable of being exploited. A threat is a person who is capable of exploiting a vulnerability. 
	If your goal is to eliminate all <a href="\root\terms\cybersecurity\risk.html">risk</a> associated 
	with operating a business or organization, you're going to have a bad time. The evolution of technology is constant, and risk landscapes are ever evolving. Although the idea to eliminate all risk is sound,
	the practical application of this concept is inconceivable. What we can do is eliminate as much risk as possible, and we can also remain constantly vigiliant of risks evolving on the horizon. 
</p>
<p>
	A good threat analysis begins with
	a comprehensive list of <a href="\root\terms\cybersecurity\assets.html">assets</a>, 
	a detailed report of <a href="\root\terms\cybersecurity\risk.html">risk</a> associated with each <a href="\root\terms\cybersecurity\assets.html">asset</a>, 
	an analysis of how these <a href="\root\terms\cybersecurity\risk.html">risks</a>
	can be exploited, a report of who is able to exploit these vulnerabilities, and an understanding that
	not all <a href="\root\terms\cybersecurity\risk.html">risks</a> will be able to be mitigated. As a business owner, it's your job to decide which <a href="\root\terms\cybersecurity\risk.html">risks</a>
	 are worth the expense to mitigate.
