<h2><strong>Title: Why are Models Useful in Economics?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What is a Model?</strong></p>
<p>
	As I have defined before, a <a href="root\terms\economics\model.html">model</a> is a simplified representation of reality that is used to better understand a 
	real-life situation. Models are useful to economists because they help us predict the outcome of a situation. For example,
	predicting how raising the minimum wage across the entire country would be very difficult. One way to better understand how this would impact
	the larger economy (the economy of the entire country) is by testing this on a smaller economy. We could raise the minimum wage in a city with a large economy to better understand the results. 
	That is, before testing this idea out on the larger economy and potentially disrupting the entire country.
</p>

<section>
<p><strong><a href="root\terms\economics\other-things-equal-assumption.html">Other Things Equal Assumption</a>.</strong></p>
<p>
	To construct a model, we must assume that some factors remain constant. When we change one factor, we must assume 
	that all other relevant factors remain unchanged. For example, our model where we would try raising the minimum wage in a 
	city with a large economy.
	We must assume all factors of this cities economy are to remain constant. Model forecasting is based off of many assumptions, which does not always end in a reliable forecast.

<!-- Section Three: Why are models useful - conclusion. -->
<section>
<p><strong>Why are Models Useful?</strong></p>
<p> Models help us predict real-life situations and scenarios. In our model where we raised the minimum wage in a large city, we were able to gather data and results
	that allowed us to better understand the impact of raising the minimum wage across the country. As is the case with most models, the data and results are what we are after.
	Accurate data and results are what help us make informed decisions.
