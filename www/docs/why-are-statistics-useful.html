<p><strong> What are Statistics?</strong></p>
<p>
	What are statistics? What is statistics? These questions have multiple answers.
	<a href="root\terms\business-statistics\statistics.html">Statistics</a> 
	is the 
	collecting, organizing, presenting, and analyzing of data to assist in making more effective decisions. A statistic is a numerical
	fact used to communicate a piece of information. An example of a statistic would be:

<!-- Section Two: Types of statistics. -->
<section>
<p><strong>Types of Statistics.</strong></p>
<p>
	When we use statistics to generate information for decision making from data, we use either <a href="root\terms\business-statistics\descriptive-statistics.html">descriptive statistics</a> or <a href="root\terms\business-statistics\inferential-statistics.html">inferential statistics</a>.
	Descriptive statistics is the method of organizing, summarizing, and presenting data in an informative way. 
	Sometimes, we must make decisions on a limited set of data. A <a href="root\terms\business-statistics\population.html">population</a>, the entire set of individuals or objects of interest 
	or the measurement obtained from all individuals or or obects of interest, is considered to be a set. At times, we may <a href="root\terms\business-statistics\sample.html">sample</a> 
	a portion, or part, of a population of interest.
	When we do not want to poll an entire population, we use a small set of data from the population and we refer to this as the sample.
	The process of sampling from a population with the objective of estimating properties of a population is called inferential statistics.

<!-- Section Three: why are statistics useful. -->
<section>
<p><strong> Why are Statistics Useful?</strong></p>
<p>
	Statistics are useful because they enable us to provide visual representations of data sets. These data sets are often compiled to communicate an idea about a population.
	Gathering and analyzing data is how we come to make an informed decision. Making decisions without appropriate information often leads to unfortunate consequences.
	Statistics are also useful because they enable us to make informed decisions.
