<h3> About:</h3>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong></p>

<p>	
	My name is Michael Anthony Borchardt; I was born in Yakima, Washington. I believe
	each of us is a cumulative representation of our personal experiences. Our experiences shape who we are, how we act,
	and what we are capable of understanding. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Foremost, I am a penetration tester
	and a cybersecurity enthusiast. I am highly specialized in assessing vulnerabilities in web applications, exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications via penetration testing methods, and providing security patches
	to web applications. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I am incredibly passionate about what I do. I pride myself in having great communication skills. Feel free to email me with any questions.

<section>
<p><strong>Education.</strong></p>
<p>
	From the years of 2011 to 2015, I attended Yakima Valley College. At Yakima Valley College, I spent my time completing an Associate of Arts &amp; Sciences degree. While attending Yakima Valley College, I also spent
	much time studying information systems, cybersecurity, and web application development. 
	From the years of 2022 to 2028, I am attending Adams State University working on earning a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration. Although I am a Business Administration major, I still continue to invest
	much time into personal studies. Furthermore, I am refining my craft in web application security.

<!-- Section Three: Skills -->
<section>
<p><strong>Skills.</strong></p>
<p>
	As a result of my experiences, I have a highly diversified skill set. I am great at assesssing vulnerabilities in web applications, and I have much experience doing this. 
	As I've stated, I am highly specialized in penetration testing web applications. If there is a vulnerability in a web application, I 
	believe I could find it.
	 However, I do have a good fundamental knowledge of information systems, cybersecurity best practices,
	and software development. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I am an experienced problem solver, and I see each problem as an opportunity to learn something new.
	</p>
	<p>
	I have used several server platforms for website hosting, which range from Apache to Microsoft Azure. I have experience writing secure code for websites
	in multiple languages, too. Thus far, my favorite has been working with C# and Microsoft Azure. It is very simple to write secure code for a website on the Microsoft Azure platform.
