<p>
	Ping is a command built into most operating systems that is used to send echo request datagrams to network hosts, which are often internet protocol addresses or resolvable domain names. 
	Echo requests function over the ICMP. ICMP is shorthand for "Internet Control Message Protocol."  
	Although the command is called "ping," the name for the actual string of bytes being transmitted
	is an ICMP echo request datagram. They are not ping packets. For example, if someone is telling you to send an echo request to network host address 127.0.0.1, they're communicating to you to ping localhost. However, when you send
	an echo request to a host, you should anticipate this host to respond with an echo response. Moreover, sometimes a host does not respond. If a host doesn't respond, this does not mean that the host is not there. This
	only determines that the specific host you sent an echo request to is not responsive to echo requests.
