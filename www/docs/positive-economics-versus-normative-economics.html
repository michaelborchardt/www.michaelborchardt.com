<!-- Why do countries trade -->
<p><strong> What is Positive Economics? </strong></p>
<p>
	Positive economics is the branch of economic analysis that describes the way the economy actually works. For example, what would happen to the domestic
	economy if the government were to raise taxes on the middle class by 8% next year? This is a positive economics question; furthermore, this is a question 
	about how the economy actually works.
	
</p>
<p><strong> What is Normative Economics?</strong></p>
<p>
	Normative economics makes prescriptions about the way the economy should work. Should the government raise taxes on the middle class by 8% next year? Is this what is best
	for the economy? These are normative economic questions. Often times, normative economic questions have the word "should" in them.
</p>
<p><strong> Positive Economics Versus Normative Economics.</strong></p>
<p>
	Economists will ask positive economic questions to better understand cause and effect. What will happen if we add (x) to (y)? Positive economic
	questions help us model the impact of regulatory controls. Economists help better understand the economy by modeling questions about policy before implmenting said policy.
	Normative economics, as already stated, raise questions about how the economy should work. They're always going to be multiple solutions to a single problem. Normative economics raises questions
	about these solutions to best create policy which help creates the greatest good for the most people.
