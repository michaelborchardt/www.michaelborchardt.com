<h2>Title: What is an Unknown Unknown?</h2>

	<p>
	If you don't know, an unknown unknown is a threat that we don't know we don't know about. Ya know? 
	</p>
	<p>
	To a security analyst, there is a grid with four quadrants which defines different classes of threats. In the first quadrant, we have threats that we know we know about. 
	In quadrant two, they're threats we know we don't know about.
	In quadrant three, they're threats we don't know we know about. And then, alas, they're threats we don't know we don't know about.
	</p>
	<p>
	I would like to define an example of each type of threat. An example of a threat we're aware we know of is risk to critical energy and supply chain infrastructure
	from foreign hacker cells. We're aware that there is a threat to critical energy and supply chain infrastructure, which is why securing this infrastructure is of utmost importance.
	</p>
	<p>
	An example of quadrant two would be us knowing we don't know who these people are, as we don't have PII
	on these individuals. Not knowing who these people are is a perceived threat. 
	An example of quadrant three would be that we're not aware that we're aware that these are hacker cells funded by foreign governments, which is probably the truth. 
	We're assuming this, although we can't prove this. In my opinion,
	this constitutes something we don't know we know about. I guess this quadrant is a supposition, or this quadrant is an assumption. Something we assume to be true, but we can't prove is true. 
	</p>
	<p>
	While last but not least, we have
	the unknown unknown. Which could be a list of future targets for foreign hacker cells. In all reality, we have no idea that we have no idea. This is the security business for a security analyst.
	Often times, you don't know which risks to mitigate. In essence, you don't know what is at risk until an event happens which places an asset at risk. 
	This is why allocating resources to figure out potential threat scenarios is so important.
